# TekView
 
 ## What is this?
 TekView is an addon for VRSL that allows for dummy rig testing without needing to use uDesktopDuplicator.
 
 This gives you the ability to easily setup dummy rigs, as you don't have to mess with an OBS fullscreen preview or precise grid node placement on a secondary 16:9 monitor.... which with this you don't even need!
 
 ## Requirements
 
 This is an ADDON for VRSL. Naturally you will need VRSL in your Unity project, along with all its requirements. This package is specifically meant to be an addon to the VRSL Lighting Bridge Node, which has OSC output capabilities.
